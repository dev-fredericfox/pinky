# Portfolio Project: Machine Learning using brain.js

### Vue 3 & Brain.js
This is a small project to hone my Vue 3 Composition API skills as well as to practice some Machine Learning, especially Neural Networks with brain.js.

Furthermore I used this project to learn about Bulma CSS, which I then also used in my Portfolio.

Lastly, upon programming this app, I also learned about parsing csvs, using JS Workers to offload some heavy work and making files available for download and writing to the browsers local storage.

I have many more ideas to make this app better and add features, so consider this an MVP.

Some features on my "road-map":
- Optimize App for Mobile use
- Adding ability to uplaod a trained brain or select from local browser storage
- Add Cross Validation
- More and better datavalidation checks
- Better Data Pre-processing
- Different Training Algorithms such as Long-Short Term Memory and Time Step Networks.
